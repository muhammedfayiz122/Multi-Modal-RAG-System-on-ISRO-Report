These produced a major geomagnetic storm on May 11, 2024. Two of the remote sensing payloads on board Aditya-L1 (SoLEXS and HEL1OS) captured these events during May 8-9, 2024 while the two in-situ payloads (ASPEX and MAG) captured this event during May 10-11, 2024 during its passage through L1. These observations were subsequently reported by ISRO, along with the observations made by the Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, XPoSat as well as by USO-PRL ground-based facility.\n",
      "855 The VELC instrument onboard Aditya-L1 captured the first spectroscopic observations of the onset phase of a CME in the 5303˚Angstrom emission line. VELC observed that the CME event caused coronal dimming (≈ 50%) for approximately 6 hours in the aftermath of the its onset, due to depletion of coronal material. It was further associated with a ~ 15% enhancement in the width of the emission line. The non-thermal velocity during the CME was found to be ≈24.87 km/s. A redshift of ≈ 10 km/s is indicated from the Doppler shift calculations. These observations from VELC/Aditya-L1 provide important clues to understand the source regions of the CMEs, and facilitate constraining the models of CMEs. The CME models, in turn, feed to the space weather models. These results are published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n",

It comprises Uncrewed flights followed by a Crewed flight involving detailed qualification of several engineering subsystems, Crew selection & training, and development of human-centric products. The mission is broadly divided into three major phases, namely, ascent phase, orbital phase, and descent phase. In the ascent phase, the human rated launch vehicle carries the Orbital Module to a low earth orbit. The orbital phase starts with the injection of the Orbital Module by the launch vehicle into an elliptical orbit. This is further raised to a circular orbit using the engines present in the Orbital Module. The orbital phase ends with the beginning of the de-boost maneuvers carried out to initiate the return journey. The descent phase begins with the de-boost maneuvers which sets the course of the module towards the designated touch-down location. A series of activities will be carried out during the descent phase, which will finally end with a low-velocity splash down at a designated location in sea waters.
